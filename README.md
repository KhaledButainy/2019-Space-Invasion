# 2019-Space-Invasion
This is a remake of the old computer game, space invaders, which was first released in 1978.
In my way to learn more about python programming, I decided to write a code of this very old computer game using (pygame) library.

Here I will list a few things I have learned through this project:
1- using classes to better organize the code.
2- gained basic knowledge about game development using Pygame library:
    * setting a background color.
    * draw images to the screen.
    * move the images and make them interact with each other.
    * give the user the control to move the images, start and close the game.
3- tracking the player score by designing a scoring-system that give the player information
about his current score and the highest score in the game.
